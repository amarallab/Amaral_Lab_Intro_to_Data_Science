Most challenges that you will encounter have already been solved by someone else, it's just a matter of knowing how to find and interpret the posted solutions.\n",

And if you're not already proficient at articulating the precise nature of your problem when searching with [Google](https://www.google.com), prepare to learn. \n",

    "When thinking about libraries or even code you see somewhere, it is important to think about **responsibility** and **maintenance**. Responsibility refers to the individuals or organizations releasing the code.  Is this a beginner or an established organizations such as the **Python Software Foundation**? The Python Software Foundation is much more likely to release tested, validated, well-written code, to have a system for users to reports **bugs**, and to resolve reported bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintenance refers to the process by which code is made compatible with new releases of other code that it depends upon.  Think of any piece of software as a building made of bricks. Each brick is another piece of code that the building depends upon for stability.  What makes the situation truly complex is that bricks are always being remade. If the building does not respond to changes in the bricks, it will just collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any release of `Python` will include the so-called `Standard Library`. A key principle with the functions included in the `Standard Library` is **trust** -- they will work and will work well. However, `Standard Library` is quite limited in scope. That is the reason why we have asked you to downloaded the pun-ly named `Anaconda` is because it includes many libraries that have been vetted and that are known to work well together and to be well maintained. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When you find an answer to a question on stackoverflow, your confidence in that answer should be tempered and the results tested. If it's in the `Python Standard Library`, thousands of people have already tested it and it works. The same goes for some other very common packages, such as those included in `Anaconda`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the source code of all those libraries is distributed widely.  You can read it, check it, learn from it. You should avoid random libraries from unknown users whose source code is not distributed. **When you run them, you are giving that code your permissions to change things in the computer.  They could encrypt or delete your data, steal your personal information, take control of your camera and microphone, attack sites in the Internet under your name, damage your hardware.** \n"
