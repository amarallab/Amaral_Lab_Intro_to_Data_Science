    "A **statistical hypothesis** is a statement about a **parameter of one or more populations**.  We typically consider two competing models in hypotheses testing: the **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis**.  The null hypothesis is the one assumed initially to be true, and the alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. \n",

The **power of a statistical test**, expressed as $1-\\beta$, is the **probability of accepting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true**.
