A pre-processed biological sample is then drop over the chip and and allowed to bind to the probe polymers.  After a wash, in which not correctly binded material is supposed to be washed away, the sample is exposed to a laser and fluorescent molecules attached to the biological material emit light that is capture and quantified in a photomultiplier device.\n",
